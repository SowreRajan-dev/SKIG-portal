    description:
      "Helium is a colourless, odourless, insipid and non-toxic gas. It's less soluble in water than any other gas. It's the less reactive element and doesn't essentially form chemical compounds. The density and viscosity of helium vapour are very low",

    description:
      "Nitrogen is a naturally occurring element that is essential for growth and reproduction in both plants and animals. It is found in amino acids that make up proteins, in nucleic acids, that comprise the hereditary material and life's blueprint for all cells, and in many other organic and inorganic compounds.",

    description:
      "Oxygen is a colourless, odourless, tasteless gas essential to living organisms, being taken up by animals, which convert it to carbon dioxide; plants, in turn, utilize carbon dioxide as a source of carbon and return the oxygen to the atmosphere.",
